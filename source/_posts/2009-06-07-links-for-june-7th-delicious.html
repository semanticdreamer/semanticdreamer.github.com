<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for June 7th from 15:37 to 15:43:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ebiquity.umbc.edu/project/html/id/82/RDF123">RDF123</a> - is an application and web service - from UMBC&rsquo;s Ebiquity program - for converting data in simple spreadsheets to an RDF graph.</li>
<li><a href="http://marbles.sourceforge.net/">Marbles Linked Data Engine</a> - is a server-side application that formats Semantic Web content for XHTML clients using Fresnel lenses and formats. Colored dots are used to correlate the origin of displayed data with a list of data sources, hence the name.</li>
<li><a href="http://motools.sourceforge.net/event/event.html">Event Ontology</a> - is centered around the notion of event, seen here as the way by which cognitive agents classify arbitrary time/space regions.</li>

</ul>
