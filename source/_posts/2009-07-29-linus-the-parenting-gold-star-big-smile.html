<p>I had a big, big smile while reading Linus Torvalds latest blog post titled <a href="http://torvalds-family.blogspot.com/2009/07/parenting-gold-star.html">Parenting gold star (?)</a>. Here is why - enjoy, as much as I did!:-)</p> 

<p>One of his children, Celeste (8), was asked in Tae-Kwon-Do summer camp to write a letter home about how she is thankful to their parents.</p>

<p>She is starting like follows:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Celeste:</strong> "<cite>You buy me lunch, breakfast and dinner. You bought me animals to play with so I could have a lot of fun in my life.</cite>"</blockquote>

<p>... nice, fine so far...</p>

<blockquote><strong>Celeste:</strong> "<cite>You also let me bury them instead of flushing them down the toilet.</cite>"</blockquote>

<p>Well, yeah, something that does obviously really count for a child. As Linus states: <em>premium parenting</em>  Clearly have to remeber this!</p>

<blockquote><strong>Linus:</strong> "<cite>Ooh, yeah! That's some premium parenting there. Gold stars all around!</cite>"</blockquote>

<p>Closing clause:</p>

<blockquote><strong>Linus:</strong> "<cite>Of course, she has clearly forgotten about the fish. We did flush those.</cite>"</blockquote>
