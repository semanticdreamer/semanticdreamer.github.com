<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for October 15th through October 16th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> - a small and simple JavaScript library that helps you take advantage of emerging web technologies (CSS3, HTML 5) while still maintaining a fine level of control over older browsers that may not yet support these new technologies.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.blindtextgenerator.com/">blindtextgenerator.com</a> - a dummy Text Generator, Lorem ipsum for webdesigners.</li>

</ul>
