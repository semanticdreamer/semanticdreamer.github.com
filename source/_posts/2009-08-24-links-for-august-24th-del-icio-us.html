<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for August 24th from 07:13 to 10:38:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sindice.com/">Sindice - The semantic web index</a> - is based on DERI&rsquo;s unique cluster technology which indexes and operates over terascale semantic data sets (trillions of statements) while also providing very high query throughputs per cluster size. Over 10 billion pieces of reusable information can already be found across 100 million web pages which embed RDF and Microformats. indice is created at DERI, the world&rsquo;s largest institute for Semantic Web research.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.okkam.org/">Welcome to OKKAM - Enabling the Web of Entities</a> - A web-scale open service called Entity Name System (ENS) for supporting the systematic reuse of identifiers for &quot;things&quot; - project co-funded by the European Commission.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.freebase.com/apps/docs/acre">Acre -  Freebase's Application Hosting Platform</a> - an application hosting platform designed to minimize the effort required by the Freebase community to build web applications that make use of the data contained by Freebase and create mashups with web services provided by others.</li>
<li><a href="http://personas.media.mit.edu/">Personas</a> - is a component of the Metropath(ologies) exhibit, currently on display at the MIT Museum by the Sociable Media Group from the MIT Media Lab. It uses sophisticated natural language processing and the Internet to create a data portrait of one&#39;s aggregated online identity. In short, Personas shows you how the Internet sees you.</li>

</ul>
