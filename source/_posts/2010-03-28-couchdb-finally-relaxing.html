<blockquote>"CouchDB is a document-oriented database that can be queried and indexed in a MapReduce fashion using JavaScript [...]Â provides a RESTful JSON API than can be accessed from any environment that allows HTTP requests [...] is written in Erlang [...]"

<p>Check out <a href="http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp">CouchApp</a> in order to write CouchDB applications by using just JavaScript and HTML.</p>

<blockquote>"CouchApp is designed to structure standalone CouchDB application development for maximum application portability. CouchApp is a set of scripts and a jQuery plugin designed to bring clarity and order to the freedom of CouchDB's document-based approach."
