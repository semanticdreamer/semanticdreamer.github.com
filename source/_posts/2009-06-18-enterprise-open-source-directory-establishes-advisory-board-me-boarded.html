<p>The <a href="http://www.eosdirectory.com/">EOS directory</a> is the leading online platform to help enterprises and organizations identify and evaluate Open Source technologies.</p>

<p>Intially launched by <a href="http://www.optaros.com/">Optaros</a>, about two years ago, the platform has been recently handed over <a href="http://www.accelit.ch/">Bruno von Rotz</a>, initial sponsor of the initiative and well known Open Source specialist (follow Bruno on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/accelIT">accelIT</a>).</p>

<p>In support to strengthen the neutral approach to ratings and selection of the technologies, the new <strong>EOS Directory Advisory and Expert Board</strong> has been established over the last weeks and <a href="http://www.eosdirectory.com/blogs/2009/06/17/eos-directory-establishing-advisory-and-expert-board-with-key-open-source-experts/">announced today</a>.</p>
