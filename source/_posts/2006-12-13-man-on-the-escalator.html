Something I'd really like to know: why does it feel strange to walk a broken escalator but does not feel the same walking a "normal" stairway?<br />Once in a while it happens to me that a escalator (that I have to pass on my way to work each day) is broken - not moving anymore. So I have to walk. Ok, as I'm usually in hurry to catch the underground I tend to walk down the escalator in any case - but: it feels really "strange" when it's not moving. Is this only because I'm so much used to it - sort of daily routine? Or is there more to it? Physics + psychology "mashed-up"? Or some total mystery in the end...?<br />
