<a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">Project Sun SPOT</a> - an initiative of <a href="http://research.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems Laboratories</a> to make sure that the next generation of gadgets is based on Sun technology.<br />The Vision: <strong>Programming the Real-world</strong><br /><em>Inspiring Java developers to create a whole new breed of devices and technologies - and accelerating the growth of the "Internet of Things"</em> (<a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">Project Sun SPOT</a>)<br />What is a Sun SPOT device?<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="sunspot" src="{{ root_url }}/rw-journal/files/projectsunspotsmllprogr_1.jpg" width="307" height="348"/><br />"<em>The Sun SPOT Device is a small, wireless, battery powered experimental platform. It is programmed almost entirely in Java to allow regular programmers to create projects that used to require specialized embedded system development skills. The hardware platform includes a range of built-in sensors as well as the ability to easily interface to external devices.</em>" (<a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">Project Sun SPOT</a>)<br /><strong>What I like about it?</strong><br />Well, ...<br /><ul class="(null)"><li>first of all the vision itself: "accelerating the growth of the "Internet of Things".</li><li>the focus on Java: allowing "developers to write a program in Java, load it on a device, run it, and debug it with standard Java IDEs". Which is exactly why I personaly think the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google's Android</a> will be a huge stakeholder in the mobile industry to come.</li><li>the open philosophie allowing to leverage the technology in which ever context you like, reaching from education to hoobyists.</li></ul>
