<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for July 2nd from 13:54 to 13:54:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://semantictweet.com/">SemanticTweet</a> - To see your twitter friends and followers as a FOAF document: instead of having to hand-craft your FOAF file, or use a service such as FOAF-a-matic you can now embed a reference to this service directly in your homepage, blog, or whatever, without ever needing to upload or update any files.</li>

</ul>
