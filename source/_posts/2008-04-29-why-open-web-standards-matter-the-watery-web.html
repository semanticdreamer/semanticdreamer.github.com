<p>Couldn't agree more to the essence of the following great metaphor that I stumbled upon while reading the post <a href="http://browsing.justdiscourse.com/2008/04/22/deconstructing-rich-internet-applications/">Deconstructing Rich Internet Applications</a> by <a href="http://browsing.justdiscourse.com/about/">Matthew Gertner</a>:</p> 

<blockquote>"<cite>Think of the web, of the Internet itself, as water. Proprietary platforms based on the web are ice cubes. They can, for a time, suspend themselves above the web at large. But over time, they only ever melt into the water. And maybe they make it better when they do.</cite>"</blockquote>
