<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for February 10th from 22:10 to 22:10:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.bashflash.com/">BashFlash - A different kind of Flash blocker for Snow Leopard</a> - On 64-bit Macs running Snow Leopard, Safari pushes the Flash plug-in off into its own process. BashFlash lives as a tiny menu app, monitoring this process and warns you (by turning red) if Flash is using a relatively significant amount of processor cycles. You can then use its menu to kill the Flash plug-in.</li>

</ul>
