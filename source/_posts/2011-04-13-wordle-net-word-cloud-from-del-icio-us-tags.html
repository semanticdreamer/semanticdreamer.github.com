You can tweak your clouds with different fonts, layouts, and color schemes. The images you create with Wordle are yours to use however you like. You can print them out, or save them to the Wordle gallery to share with your friends."</cite> (Source: <a href="http://wordle.net">wordle.net</a>)</blockquote>
