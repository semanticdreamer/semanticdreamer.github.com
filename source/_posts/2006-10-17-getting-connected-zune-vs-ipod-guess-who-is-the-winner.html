The following quote - that I've read via <div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.notio.com/">Michael J.'s Notio</a></u></div > (<div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/">Getting Connected</a></u></div >) - made me smile sooooo... much! Enjoy!<br />"Classic Steve Jobs <div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/">quote</a></u></div >:<br /><strong>Microsoft has announced its new iPod competitor, Zune. It says that this device is all about building communities. Are you worried?</strong><br />In a word, no. I've seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times. It takes forever. By the time you've gone through all that, the girl's got up and left! You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable.<br />The guy sure knows how to give good media."
