<p>Yesterday I recieved my account upgrade to <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">Google App Engine</a> for Java:</p>

<p><blockquote>"<cite>Welcome to an early look at Google App Engine for Java!</cite>"</blockquote></p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://appengine.google.com/"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dLfQMJsmsaI/SdvwPx8hz5I/AAAAAAAAACY/I_DEfn6nQjc/s320/ae_gwt_java.png"/></a></p>

<p>So far I did only have a quick look at the new version, mainly playing around with the starter project.</p>

<p>But what is already clear: the Google engineering team did an awesome job to provide developers with a tool, read <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/eclipse/">Google Plugin for Eclipse</a> supported development workflow to get started as well as to boost the overall application development cycle in total (code, test, debug, deploy). And even more in regard to <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/de-DE/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> application development...</p>

<p>Pretty cool!</p>
