<p>Yesterday I recieved a notification that my "Personal Annual Report for 2008" for my <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/mgeisler">Dopplr</a> account is available and awaiting my download - but until now I didn't found time to actually have a look at it...</p>

<p>... only in order to learn:</p>

<blockquote><ul><li><cite>You [me] took 8 trips in 2008, which added 
up to 43,602 km or 12% of the distance to the moon.</cite></li><li><cite>In 2008, you [me] spent 339 Day at Home [and] 27 travelling.</cite></li></ul></blockquote>

<p>... resulting in:</p>

<blockquote><cite>Your personal velocity for 2008 was 4.97 
km/h, <strong>which is about the same as a duck</strong>.</cite></blockquote>

<p>What's your velocity?</p>
