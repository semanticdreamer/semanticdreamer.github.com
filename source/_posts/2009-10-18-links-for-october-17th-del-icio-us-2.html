<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for October 17th through October 18th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://velocity.apache.org/docbook/">Apache Velocity DocBook Framework (DBF)</a> - This project started out as a framework to render documentation for the Apache Velocity project and ended somehow up to be a generic framework to render DocBook documents using Java and driven by Apache ant.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/virtualhost-sh/">virtualhost-sh</a> - This script allows you to easily create virtual hosts for a development environment on Mac OS X with the built-in Apache server so that you can reflect a production environment locally.</li>

</ul>
