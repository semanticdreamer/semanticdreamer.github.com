<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for June 13th from 13:59 to 13:59:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://commontag.org/Home">Common Tag</a> - an open tagging format developed to make content more connected, discoverable and engaging. Unlike free-text tags, Common Tags are references to unique, well-defined concepts, complete with metadata and their own URLs.</li>

</ul>
