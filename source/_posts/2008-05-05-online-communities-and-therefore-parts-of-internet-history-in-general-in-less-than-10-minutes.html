<p>If the topic caught your attention you probably don't want to miss the following video in which <a title="Ethan Zuckerman" href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/ezuckerman" target="_blank">Ethan Zuckerman</a> recounts some of the "milestones" in the history of online communities - and therefore large parts of the history of the internet in general - in just about seven minutes.</p>
<p>Very entertaining!</p>
