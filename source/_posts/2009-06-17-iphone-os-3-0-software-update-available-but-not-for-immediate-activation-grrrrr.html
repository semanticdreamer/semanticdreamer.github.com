<p>Download succeeded, but activation failed due to activation server <em>temporality</em> not available. Most probably <strong>overloaded</strong> - or should I say <strong>overwhelmed</strong>?!</p>

<p>... the downside of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> being a huge success in a global community that is all about early adoption - even for software updates! ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Update 18.06.</strong> I finally managed to install and activate the update early morning today - probably could have managed to do so late night yesterday as well, but after all didn't feel it's worth the price of feeling sleepy all day.</p>
