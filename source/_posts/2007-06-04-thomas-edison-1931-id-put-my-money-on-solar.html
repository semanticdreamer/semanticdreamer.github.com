<p>This visionary and so(!) current thinking from a past green pioneer (Thomas Edison, 1931) makes me cry!!!</p><blockquote>"In 1931, not long before he died, the inventor [Thomas Edison] told his friends Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone: 'I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.'"</blockquote><p>Short prayer to myself: please let us (manking) listen more carefully to wise, visionary women and men while they are still alive or at least <b>let's act, immediately - NOW!!!</b></p><p>(Via <a href="http://www.ecogeek.org/">EcoGeek.org</a>: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/EcoGeek/%7E3/121919720/">Thomas Edison, 1931: "I'd Put My Money on Solar"</a>.)</p>
