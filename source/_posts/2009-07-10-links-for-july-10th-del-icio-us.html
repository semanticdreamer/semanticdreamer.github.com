<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for July 10th from 15:08 to 15:08:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.openanzo.org/">Open Anzo</a> - includes both an open source enterprise-featured RDF quad store and a sophisticated service oriented, semantic middleware platform that provides support for multiple users, distributed clients, offline work, real-time notification, named-graph modularization, versioning, access controls, and transactions.</li>

</ul>
