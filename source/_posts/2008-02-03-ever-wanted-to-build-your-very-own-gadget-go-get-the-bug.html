<p>The <a href="http://buglabs.net/products">BUG</a> itself as well as the additional modules for the <em>BUG</em>, provided by it's manufactorer <a href="">Bug Labs</a>, is best descriped by the title of an <a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9809763-2.html">CNET article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"<cite>Bug Labs: The Lego of gadgets.</cite>"</blockquote>

It also has a tripod mount because, well, why not? Each BUGbase houses four connectors for users to combine any assortment of BUGmodules to create their ultimate gadget.</cite>"</blockquote>

<p>Any hey, didn't we all love <a href="http://www.lego.com/e">Lego</a> in our younger days - or some of us even still today ;-)?</p>

<p><strong>Broad hint</strong>: wouldn't this be a nice present? :-)</p>

<p>To bad that we have to wait quite some time until christmas...</p>
