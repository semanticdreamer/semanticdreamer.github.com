Today I read the following status message on the <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Messenger</a>(!!!) of a business partner ... and laughed out loud :-):

<blockquote><cite>"If MS buys Yahoo I'll say bye to you, Yahoo!"</cite></blockquote>

<p>Of course I immediately assured myself the permission to publish this statement - and to probably use as my IM status as well ;-)...</p>
