<p><a href="http://scr.im/">Scr.im</a> is a simple but nicely built free service (currently in beta) to convert your email address into a short, cute and safe link that you can share on the web.</p>

<p><strong>Why would you want to do this?</strong> Well, of course to get less spam! ;-)</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> Instead of tricking around to obfuscate your email address with some nasty JavaScript hack people willing to email you will go to this URL (e.g. <a href="http://scr.im/matthias">http://scr.im/matthias</a>) that will reveal your email address, after a simple test that automated scripts and bots cannot pass.</p>
