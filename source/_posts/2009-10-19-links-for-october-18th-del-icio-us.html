<p>These are semanticdreamer's del.icio.us bookmarks for October 18th from 11:51 to 11:51:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://velocity.apache.org/docbook/">Apache Velocity DocBook Framework (DBF)</a> - This project started out as a framework to render documentation for the Apache Velocity project and ended somehow up to be a generic framework to render DocBook documents using Java and driven by Apache ant.</li>

</ul>
