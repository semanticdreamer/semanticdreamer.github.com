At first I was asking myself: which date do we have - april 1th? But after cross-reading Michael's post I heared my self saying "YES" - ending up with a *big* healthy smile early in the morning - of course, especially for the last sentence :-)...<br />Although I don't have a cat myself (at the moment!) I know from my past experience with "Willi" what this tool is for - actually I know _to good_ ;-).<br />"<div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.bitboost.com/pawsense/">PawSense</a></u></div >: Catproof your computer.
When cats walk or climb on your keyboard, they can enter random commands and data, damage your files, and even crash your computer. This can happen whether you are near the computer or have suddenly been called away from it. PawSense is a software utility that helps protect your computer from cats. It quickly detects and blocks cat typing, and also helps train your cat to stay off the computer keyboard. Of course, Windows-only. Everyone knows Mac cats are much better trained and there's no market for remedial catproofing software."<br />(Via <div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.notio.com/">Michael J.'s Notio</a></u></div >: <div style="display: inline;color:#000CED;"><u><a href="http://www.bitboost.com/pawsense/">PawSense</a></u></div >.)<br />
