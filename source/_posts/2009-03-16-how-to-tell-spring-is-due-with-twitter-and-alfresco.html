<p>It's as simple as three little steps:</p>

<p><ol>
<li>create a simple Twitter search with query 'Alfresco', e.g. with <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a></li>
<li>split and count the tweets in the result set into 'Alfresco' being mentioned as<br/>a) x=COUNT(related to <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/">Alfresco</a>, the OSS ECM/ WCM) or<br/>b) y=COUNT(meaning 'in the open'; 'in the open air'; 'outside'; 'out of doors')</li>
<li>Calc the ratio z=y/x</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Here you go: the higher z the closer is spring! Or at least the better the weather has been the last 24h ;-)...</p>
